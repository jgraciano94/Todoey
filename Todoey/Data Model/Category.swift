    @objc dynamic var name : String = ""

    // here we are going to create the forward relationship i.e. inside each category there is this thing called items which is going to point to a list of Item objects It is going to set equal to a collection type called 'List'. This is something that comes from Realm, and it is basically a container type (just as arrays and dictionaries are container types). It is very similar to arrays
    // we are going to create a constant called items and it is going to hold a list of Item objects and we're going to initialize it as an empty list
    let items = List<Item>()
    
    
}
