        // Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state. This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state.
        // Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and invalidate graphics rendering callbacks. Games should use this method to pause the game.
        
        // this tends to get triggered when say something happens to the phone while the app is open i.e. in the foreground. So say if the user receives a call, this is the method where you can do something to prevent the use of losing data. So for example, say if the user were filling in a form in your app and in the middle of it they get a call. It would be really annoying if at the end of the call, the app terminated and lost all of their data

        // Called when the application is about to terminate. Save data if appropriate. See also applicationDidEnterBackground:.
        
        // This is the point where basically your app is going to be terminated. This can be user triggered or system triggered. Let's say we close out of one app and enter another and let's also say this other app is very resource intensive (such as a game), then it might reclaim some of the resources of the app in the background. When this happens, it goes from being in the background to being terminated by the OS
