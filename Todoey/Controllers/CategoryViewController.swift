class CategoryViewController: SwipeTableViewController {
    // we have to conform to the SwipeTableViewCellDelegate protocol according to the SwipeCellKit documentation
    
    // initialize a new realm
    // the try! is what you would call a code smell or a bad smell. It is something that indicates or hints at possibly bad code and maybe a deeper problem but not always
    // the Reason this Realm() initialization throws an error is because according to Realm, the first time when you are creating a new Realm instance, it can fail if your resources are constrained. In practice, this can only happen the first time a Realm instance is created on a given thread
    let realm = try! Realm()

    var categoryArray : Results<Category>? // Results is just an auto-updating container type (container types are things like arrays, dictionaries, results, lists) and it comes from Realm and it gets returned from object Queries. So that means whenever you try to query your Realm database, the results you get back are in the form of a Results object. This is going to contain a whole bunch of Category objects
    // we are making this an optional not force unwrapping it with an ! mark because if we forget to load up our categories below and this line was in fact nil, when we force unwrap it and try to use it to populate our Table View, we will have an issue
    

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        loadCategories()
        
        tableView.separatorStyle = .none // this erases the lines in between each cell
        
    }

    //MARK: - TableView Datasource Methods
    
    // Setup the datasource so that we can display all the categories that are inside our persistent container
    
    // there are two methods which allow us to specify what the cells should display and also how many rows we want in our Table View
    
    // first method returns the number of rows
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        // this method expects an output in a return statement that will be the number of rows
        return categoryArray?.count ?? 1 // returns the number of categories in the array initialized near the class declaration
        // here we are saying if categoryArray is not nil, then return categories.count but if it is nil, then just return 1
        // the '??' is called the Nil Coalescing operator. What this means is that the left side can be nil because categoryArray is an optional and we're only saying get the count of categoryArray if it is not nil, but if it is nil, then 'categoryArray?.count' is going to be nil and the nil coalescing operator will say use the value on the right side aka 1
    }
    
    // when this gets called, the first thing it does is because we call super, it goes into our super class and triggers the code inside our cellForRowAt indexPath()
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        // we are going to create a cell in here that is going to be a reusuable cell and add it to the table at the index path

        // we can tap into the superclass SwipeTableViewController by saying the below
        // the tableview is the same as we've got here. and the cellForAt indexPath
        // this is going to tap into that cell tha gets created inside our Super View, and it taps into the cell at the current index path and then we're going to take that cell and then we're going to add some more things to it.
        let cell = super.tableView(tableView, cellForRowAt: indexPath)
        
        if let category = categoryArray?[indexPath.row] {
            
            // The cell above is already a swipe cell, but we're going to modify it further by changing the text label to the current category
            cell.textLabel?.text = category.name ?? "No Categories Added Yet"
            
            // we can set this guard let to equal to the category color and if that doesn't work then throw a fatal error
            guard let categoryColor = UIColor(hexString: category.color) else { fatalError()}
            
            // here is the most obvious place to change the background color because we set up a cell using the superclass method and then we get back that cell and we modify it a little bit further by changing the text.
            // categoryArray is an optional so we have to use optional chaining to make sure we don't use a nil value. If categoryArray is not nil, then we are going to grab the category at indexPath.row and then tap into the color property. Color may or may not have a value, so if it doesn't have a value, we are going to say if there is no value, then here is a default value, namely "1D9BF6"
            // since we used guard let above, we can set this equal to categoryColor
            cell.backgroundColor = categoryColor
            
            // we are going to set the text color of the cell to be the contrasting color of the UIColor(hexString: category.color) and returning as a flat color
            // instead of putting UIColor(hexString: ), we can put categoryColor which we used a 'guard let' above
            cell.textLabel?.textColor = ContrastColorOf(categoryColor, returnFlat: true)
        }
        
        //final step is to return the cell
        return cell

            print(textField.text!) // to check if it the reference we created in the closure below works and is accessible globally. Prints everything that is added to the textfield after the Add Item button is pressed
            
            
        } // press enter on the last parameter to create a completion handler or a closure. This is the completion block that gets called once that "Add Category" gets pressed
        
        // in order to add a textfield to our alert (very similar to adding an action)
        // hit enter on the placeholder parameter to insert closure
