Now we have access to our app delegate as an object. We are now able to tap into its property called persistent Container. We are going to grab the viewContext of that persistent container
    // the UIApplication.shared is a singleton app instance. At the time point when our app is running live inside the user's iPhone, then the shared UI Application will correspond to our live application object.
    // Inside this shared UI Application object is something called delegate and this is the delegate of the app object alternatively known as the app delegate. We are going to downcast it as our class delegate
    // here we are grabbing a reference to the context that we are going to be using in order to CRUD our data and this is going to be the thing that's going to communicate with our persistent container

        // here we are saying go and find that prototype cell called 'CategoryCell' inside main.storyboard and generate a whole bunch of it that we can reuse
        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard

        } // press enter on the last parameter to create a completion handler or a closure. This is the completion block that gets called once that "Add Category" gets pressed

    func loadCategories(with request : NSFetchRequest<Category> = Category.fetchRequest()) {
        // here we can modify this function to take a parameter that is the request. We need to specify the data type and it is an NSFetchRequest and it is going to return an array of categories
        // since loadItems(request: request) does not make a lot of sense in English when calling it below in the extension, we can modify loadItems() above to have an external parameter. With is the external parameter and request is the internal parameter. request (the internal parameter) is going to be used inside this block of code for loadItems() and the external parameter (with) is going to be used when we call the function
        // If when we call this function and we don't provide a value for the request (i.e. in viewDidLoad() above), then we can have a default value that is simply Category.fetchRequest(). Now up in viewDidLoad(), we can call loadItems() without giving it any parameters

        //        let request : NSFetchRequest<Category> = Category.fetchRequest()// here we are creating a constant of data type NSFetchRequest that is going to fetch results in the form of categories. There are a few cases where you need to specify the data type. Here we need to specify the data type and the entity which we are trying to request.
        //        // Here we are putting an equal sign and tapping into the Category class/entity and make a new fetch request.
        
        // context.fetch() can throw an error so we have to use a do catch block
        do {
            categoryArray = try context.fetch(request) // we have to speak to our context before we can do anything with our persistent container. we type context.fetch and the fetch we want to make is our current request which is just a blank request that pulls everything that's currently inside our persistent container
            // this method has an output and returns NSFetchRequestResult which we know to be an array of items that is stored in our persistent container
            // Our context is going to fetch this broad request (variable called request above) which basically asks for everything back and once you do, then you're going to save the results inside our ItemArray which is what we used to load up our Table View Data Source

    //MARK: - TableView Delegate Methods
    
    // leave this part alone for now. This refers to what should happen when we click on one of the cells inside the category table view
    
    // this will trigger when we select one of the cells; when this delegate method gets triggered, we probably want to trigger the segue we set up earlier that takes the user from the Category View Controller to the ToDoListViewController

        // here we are going to create a new constant that is going to store a reference to the destination View Controller and we can grab this by using the segue.destination property. We are going to downcast this as a ToDoListViewController  because we know where that segue is going to take us
        let destinationVC = segue.destination as! TodoListViewController
        
        // next, we need to grab the category that corresponds to the selected cell
        if let indexPath = tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow { // this is the index path that is going to identify the current row that is selected
        // .indexPathForSelectedRow is an optional index path so we are going to wrap it with an if let and if the index path is not nil, then we are going to tap into the destination view controller and we're going to set a property in the destination view controller called selectedCategory (which we will create in our ToDoListViewController) and we're going to set it equal to our array of categories at our index path
            destinationVC.selectedCategory = categoryArray[indexPath.row]
