        // this method expects an output in a return statement that will be the number of rows
        return todoItems?.count ?? 1 // returns the number of items in the array initialized near the class declaration
        // since todoItems is an optional Result<Item>, we will use optional chaining to say, if todoItems is non-nil, then return the count. But if it is nil, then return 1
    }

        // here we are saying go and find that prototype cell called 'ToDoItemCell' inside main.storyboard and generate a whole bunch of it that we can reuse
        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard
        // the indexPath is going to be the current index path that the Table View is looking to populate
        
        if let item = todoItems?[indexPath.row] { // this item is now the item that we're currently trying to set up for the cell
        // here we will use optional binding saying if todoItems is not nil, then grab the item at indexPath.row and if all of this works and it is not nil, then in that case, we're going to change all of our accessories based on the item.title and the item.done properties
            
            //Once we got our cell dequeued, the next step is to set the text label. This is the label that's in every single cell and we're going to set its text property and we're going to set it to equal the items in our item array
            cell.textLabel?.text = item.title // this is the current row of the current index that we are populating. We need to tap into the title property using the dot notation since this will return an Item object
            
            // here we are using a ternary operator
            // Value = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
            // We have this condition and we check to see if it is true or it is false. If its true, then we set this value to a particular value if its true and if it's not true then we set it to something else
            
            //        cell.accessoryType = item.done == true ? .checkmark :.none
            // the above is the format for the ternary operator, however, you can go one step further and remove the '== true'
            cell.accessoryType = item.done ? .checkmark : .none
            // this expression is a smaller format that does the exact thing as the 5 lines below
            // this cell now reads: set the cell's accessory type depending on whether the item.done is true. If it is true, then set it to checkmark. If it's not true, set it to .none
            
        } else {
            // however, if it is nil or if it fails, then we're going to say
            cell.textLabel?.text = "No Items Added"

        // if todoItems?[indexPath.row] is not nil, then we are going to able to access this item object and we can say

We have todoItems, which is the array of Results that consists of items, and we're going to set its new value to be equal to its previous value (+ .filter) filtered by its predicate. We can specify the predicate format and arguments that we want to use for our filter
        // the filter method from realm takes an NSPredicate as in input
        // the format is the same as Core Data. The title of the items CONTAINS %a (which is the argument). Add the [cd] to make it case and diacritic insensitive to the argument that we are going to pass in. The argument is going to be the searchBar.text!

        // we can tag on a sort by simply adding a .sorted(byKeyPath). Keypath is 'title' and that's what we're going to sort our results by and ascending will be set to true, so it's alphabetical order

It sounds complicated, but all it means is that it should no longer be the thing that is currently selected. Go back to the background or to the original state you're in before you were activated.
