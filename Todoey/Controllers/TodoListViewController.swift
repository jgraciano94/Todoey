Now we have access to our app delegate as an object. We are now able to tap into its property called persistent Container. We are going to grab the viewContext of that persistent container
    // the UIApplication.shared is a singleton app instance. At the time point when our app is running live inside the user's iPhone, then the shared UI Application will correspond to our live application object.

    //MARK: - Tableview Datasource Methods

        // this method expects an output in a return statement that will be the number of rows
        return itemArray.count // returns the number of items in the array initialized near the class declaration
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        // we are going to create a cell in here that is going to be a resuable cell
        
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "ToDoItemCell", for: indexPath)
        // here we are saying go and find that prototype cell called 'ToDoItemCell' inside main.storyboard and generate a whole bunch of it that we can reuse
        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard
        // the indexPath is going to be the current index path that the Table View is looking to populate
        
        let item = itemArray[indexPath.row] // this item is now the item that we're currently trying to set up for the cell
        
        //Once we got our cell dequeued, the next step is to set the text label. This is the label that's in every single cell and we're going to set its text property and we're going to set it to equal the items in our item array
        cell.textLabel?.text = item.title // this is the current row of the current index that we are populating. We need to tap into the title property using the dot notation since this will return an Item object
        
        // here we are using a ternary operator
        // Value = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
        // We have this condition and we check to see if it is true or it is false. If its true, then we set this value to a particular value if its true and if it's not true then we set it to something else
        
        //        cell.accessoryType = item.done == true ? .checkmark :.none
        // the above is the format for the ternary operator, however, you can go one step further and remove the '== true'
        cell.accessoryType = item.done ? .checkmark : .none
        // this expression is a smaller format that does the exact thing as the 5 lines below
        // this cell now reads: set the cell's accessory type depending on whether the item.done is true. If it is true, then set it to checkmark. If it's not true, set it to .none

//        context.delete(itemArray[indexPath.row]) // here is the method that we will need to remove our data from our context and we can specify an NSManagedObject to delete. Here we will use the NS Managed Object at the current selected row here
//        
//        itemArray.remove(at: indexPath.row) // here we are tapping into our itemArray and we are going to use the method remove at a particular index. This merely updates our itemArray which is used to populate our Table View so that when we reload the Table View we were able to refresh the latest items.
//        
//        // the order which you call these two methods: one is removing the current item from the itemArray which is used to load up the tableView Data Source (itemArray.remove) and the other one is removing the data from permanent stores (context.delete). You have to call the context.delete method first and delete it from the context before deleting it from the array otherwise the context.delete will not know what to delete.
        
//        itemArray[indexPath.row].done = !itemArray[indexPath.row].done
//        // this means that it sets the done property on the current item in the itemArray to the opposite of itemArray[indexPath.row].done (or what it is right now)

//MARK: - Search Bar Methods

// here we are creating an extension and extend the functionality of our ToDoListViewController with a search bar and some search bar methods and we can set it up to be a UISearchBarDelegate
extension TodoListViewController : UISearchBarDelegate {
    
    // this delegate method tells the delegate that the search button was tapped (this method is triggered when the search button is pressed on the search bar) and that is the point where we want to reload our table View using the text that the user has imported
    func searchBarSearchButtonClicked(_ searchBar: UISearchBar) {
        
        // in order to read from the context, we have to create a request and we have to declare the request data type and it's going to return an array of items and we are going to set this equal to Item.fetchRequest()
        let request : NSFetchRequest<Item> = Item.fetchRequest()
        
        // now we have this request above and we need to modify it so that we tag on a query that specifies what we want to get back from the database. In order to query objects using Core Data, we need to use something called an NSPredicate
        // we are going to change this from request.predicate to a create a constant - let predicate = ...
        let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "title CONTAINS[cd] %@", searchBar.text!) // we are going to initialize this predicate using a format. For the string, we are going to say title since we are going to look at the title attribute of each of our items in the item array and we are going to check that it contains a value. where it says 'args: CVarArg' (after the comma) is the argument that we're going to substitute into this %a sign. The argument is what we printed out in our print statement which is the searchBar.text!
        // when the user presses the search button then whatever we have entered inside the search bar at that time point is going to passed in to this method into the %@ sign
        // Then our query becomes: for all the items in the item array, look for the ones where the title of the item contains the text that replaces the %@ text
        // this looks different because NSPredicate is basically a foundation class that specifies how data should be fetched or filtered. It's essentially a query language. There are a whole bunch of modifiers and logical conditions that you have access to that you can put inside the format string above
        
        // (refactored) now we have structured our query, we are going to add our query to our request
        // request.predicate = predicate ; this line is deleted for refactoring purposes.
        
        // next, we can sort the data that we get back from the database in any order of our choice. We can create a sortDescriptor that is an NSSortDescriptor and we can say that we want to sort using the key that's the title of each of the items and we can sort it in alphabetical order by saying ascending equals true.
        request.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "title", ascending: true)]
        // NSSortDescriptors expects an array of NSSortDescriptors, so we have to add the square brackets to the right side to make it equivalent to request.sortDescriptors = [sortDescriptor]
        
        // (refactored) we can add the sortDescriptor to our request by saying request.sortDescriptors . Notice that it is plural and that is because it expects an array of NSSortDescriptors, but in our case we want to only specify a single sort rule. We are saying it only contains a single item below and that's a perfectly valid code
        // request.sortDescriptors = [sortDescriptor] ; this line is deleted
        
        
        // (refactored) instead of repeating the do catch block below, we can simply say loadItems() and the request I want to make is this modified request above which contains the query and the sort objectives
        loadItems(with: request, predicate: predicate)
