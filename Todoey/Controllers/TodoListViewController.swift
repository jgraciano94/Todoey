    // and then we are going to use the default file manage which is a shared file manager object
    // .default is a singleton and this singleton contains a whole bunch of URLs and they are organized by directory and domain mask
    // The Search path Directory we need to tap into is the Document directory
    // the location where we are going to look for it is inside the user domain mask, this is the user's home directory, the place where we're going to save their personal items associated with this current app
    // because this is an array, we are going to grab the first item
    // The .appendingPathComponent allows us to create a path to create our plist file. We can call the path component anything we want.

    //MARK: - Tableview Datasource Methods
    // there are two methods which allow us to specify what the cells should display and also how many rows we want in our Table View
    
    // first method returns the number of rows
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        // this method expects an output in a return statement that will be the number of rows
        return itemArray.count // returns the number of items in the array initialized near the class declaration
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        // we are going to create a cell in here that is going to be a resuable cell
        
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "ToDoItemCell", for: indexPath)
        // here we are saying go and find that prototype cell called 'ToDoItemCell' inside main.storyboard and generate a whole bunch of it that we can reuse
        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard
        // the indexPath is going to be the current index path that the Table View is looking to populate
        
        let item = itemArray[indexPath.row] // this item is now the item that we're currently trying to set up for the cell
        
        //Once we got our cell dequeued, the next step is to set the text label. This is the label that's in every single cell and we're going to set its text property and we're going to set it to equal the items in our item array
        cell.textLabel?.text = item.title // this is the current row of the current index that we are populating. We need to tap into the title property using the dot notation since this will return an Item object
        
        // here we are using a ternary operator
        // Value = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
        // We have this condition and we check to see if it is true or it is false. If its true, then we set this value to a particular value if its true and if it's not true then we set it to something else
        
        //        cell.accessoryType = item.done == true ? .checkmark :.none
        // the above is the format for the ternary operator, however, you can go one step further and remove the '== true'
        cell.accessoryType = item.done ? .checkmark : .none
        // this expression is a smaller format that does the exact thing as the 5 lines below
        // this cell now reads: set the cell's accessory type depending on whether the item.done is true. If it is true, then set it to checkmark. If it's not true, set it to .none
        
//        if item.done == true {
//            cell.accessoryType = .checkmark
//        } else {
//            cell.accessoryType = .none
//        }
        
        //final step is to return the cell
        return cell
    }
    
    //MARK: - TableView Delegate Methods
    
    // this method gets triggered whenever we click on any cell in our Table View
    // this method tells the delegate that the specified row has been selected
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
//        print(itemArray[indexPath.row]) // this is going to print the element in the itemArray into the debug console when we select one of the cells which corresponds to the number of the cell which we selected.
//         // this is going to print the element in the array that corresponds to the specific cell that is selected
        
        itemArray[indexPath.row].done = !itemArray[indexPath.row].done
        // this means that it sets the done property on the current item in the itemArray to the opposite of itemArray[indexPath.row].done (or what it is right now)
        
        saveItems()
        
        tableView.deselectRow(at: indexPath, animated: true) // now when you select a cell, it flashes gray briefly but then it goes back to being de-selected and goes back to be white which looks a lot nicer
        
        // here is a method inside this method so that we give the cell that was selected a checkmark as an accessory
