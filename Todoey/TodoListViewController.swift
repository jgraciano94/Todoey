    // first method returns the number of rows

        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard
        // the indexPath is going to be the current index path that the Table View is looking to populate
        
        //Once we got our cell dequeued, the next step is to set the text label. This is the label that's in every single cell and we're going to set its text property and we're going to set it to equal the items in our item array
