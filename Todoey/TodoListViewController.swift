class TodoListViewController: UITableViewController {

    let itemArray = ["Find Mike", "Buy Eggos", "Destroy Demogorgon"] // these are just hard coded to be the text for the first 3 cells in the Table View
    
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    }
    
    //MARK: - Tableview Datasource Methods
    // there are two methods which allow us to specify what the cells should display and also how many rows we want in our Table View
    
    // first method returns the number of rows
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        // this method expects an output in a return statement that will be the number of rows
        return itemArray.count // returns the number of items in the array initialized near the class declaration
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        // we are going to create a cell in here that is going to be a resuable cell
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "ToDoItemCell", for: indexPath)
        // The identifier is the identifier which we gave to our prototype cell in main.storyboard
        // the indexPath is going to be the current index path that the Table View is looking to populate
        
        //Once we got our cell dequeued, the next step is to set the text label. This is the label that's in every single cell and we're going to set its text property and we're going to set it to equal the items in our item array
        cell.textLabel?.text = itemArray[indexPath.row] // this is the current row of the current index that we are populating
        
        //final step is to return the cell
        return cell
    }
    
    //MARK: - TableView Delegate Methods
    
    // this method gets triggered whenever we click on any cell in our Table View
    // this method tells the delegate that the specified row has been selected
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
//        print(itemArray[indexPath.row]) // this is going to print the element in the itemArray into the debug console when we select one of the cells which corresponds to the number of the cell which we selected.
//         // this is going to print the element in the array that corresponds to the specific cell that is selected
        
        // this method removes the checkmark when it's already been selected
        if ((tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)?.accessoryType = .checkmark) != nil) {
            tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)?.accessoryType = .none
        }
        else {
            tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)?.accessoryType = .checkmark // this is grabbing a reference to the cell that is at a particular index path
            // the cell at this index path in our table is going to have an accessory type of .checkmark
        }
        
        tableView.deselectRow(at: indexPath, animated: true) // now when you select a cell, it flashes gray briefly but then it goes back to being de-selected and goes back to be white which looks a lot nicer
        
        // here is a method inside this method so that we give the cell that was selected a checkmark as an accessory
    }
